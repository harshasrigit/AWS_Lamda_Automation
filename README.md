# AWS_Lamda_Automation
Top 5 AWS Lambda Automations for Cost Optimization, Security, and Resource Management

Objective: Leverage AWS Lambda to automate key infrastructure management tasks

  a. stopping and starting EC2 instances for weekend cost savings
  b. cleaning up unused EBS volumes after snapshot backup
  triggering encryption for EBS volumes
  snapshots, AMIs
  RDS
  S3 buckets based on events
  rotating IAM access keys for enhanced security
  auto-tagging AWS standard resources for better governance and cost tracking.

These automations improve operational efficiency, security, and reduce cloud infrastructure costs.

Key Components:
# EC2 Instance Stop and Start for Cost Savings: 
# Automatically stop EC2 instances during weekends and non-business hours to reduce costs, and restart them during operational hours using Lambda scheduled events.

Unused EBS Volumes Cleanup After Snapshot Backup: 
Identify and delete unused EBS volumes post-snapshot backup using Lambda, helping to minimize storage costs by removing unnecessary resources.

Event-Based Encryption for EBS, Snapshots, AMIs, RDS, and S3 Buckets: 
Trigger automatic encryption of EBS volumes, snapshots, AMIs, RDS instances, and S3 buckets in real-time based on specific events like resource creation, enhancing data security and compliance.

IAM Access Key Rotation: 
Automate the periodic rotation of IAM user access keys using Lambda, ensuring improved security and reducing the risk of compromised credentials.


Auto-Tagging AWS Standard Resources: 
Implement Lambda functions to automatically tag newly created AWS resources, ensuring consistent tagging for cost management, resource organization, and compliance tracking.
